# Recursive-Factorial
A factorial function is created to find the factorial of a number

The factorial of a number n is: n! = n Ã— (n-1) Ã— (n-2) Ã— ... Ã— 1

I used a recursive function where:

ðŸ”¹factorial(0) and factorial(1) return 1 (base case)

ðŸ”¹Otherwise, it calls itself: n * factorial(n-1)
